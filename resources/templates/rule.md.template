# rule-name

Rules are modular instructions that Claude follows when working on matching files.
Path targeting (in frontmatter above) ensures this rule only applies when working on files matching the pattern.

## When to Apply

This rule applies when:
- Working with files matching the `paths` pattern above
- [Add specific conditions]

## Guidelines

1. [First guideline]
2. [Second guideline]
3. [Third guideline]

## Examples

Good:
```
[Example of correct behavior]
```

Avoid:

## Notes

- Rules without `paths` frontmatter apply to all files
- Use glob patterns: `src/**/*.ts`, `*.test.js`, `api/**/*`
- Rules are project-specific (stored in .claude/rules/)
